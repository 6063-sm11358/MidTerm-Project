# Mid-Term Project Working Document

I've chosen to depict ***The Hunger Games***, a series of novels by Suzanne Collins via this project.

*The Hunger Games* universe is a dystopia set in Panem, a North American country consisting of the wealthy Capitol and 13 districts in varying states of poverty. Every year, children from the first 12 districts are selected via lottery to participate in a compulsory televised battle royale death match called The Hunger Games.
